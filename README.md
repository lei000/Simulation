# Envelope VAR model simulation.
Envelope model, put forward by Cook (2010), can improve estimation and prediction. VAR model is vector autoregression for multivariate time series. 
Based on envelope model setting, simulate one order time series data, compare VAR and envelope model on estimation and prediction. Set number of repetitions, sample size, number of time series, envelope dimension, sigma and sigma0
